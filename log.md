# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2018 
#### I didn't start logging until the 5th day, so need to do some digging for this. 

### Day 4: Jan 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Added some advice to my go-to template. Experimented with repeating scenery with css animation. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I was frustrated because I didn't have as much to show as previous days. Today, I tried to focus on some small things. Break it down and have more realistic goals now that I'm back to work. Staying up late= next day's productivity plummets. Better to take a break and come back fresh.

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on a CSS Image tutorial. Tried to modify code to be cleaner.
- Worked on look of Lights Out. Organized things with flexbox, removed shadows, better responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** Not convinved about tutorials not counting, but get that real projects = real problem solving = real learning. 
Might help manage time to focus learning on solving specific issues. Tutorials then will be in moderation or weekends. 

Material design is interesting.

### Day 6: Jan 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Spent way too long trying to decide what to do today. Found an [article suggesting some projects](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178). 
- Worked on the first project. [Copying this layout](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer)

**Thoughts:** I need to create/ find a structured curriculum if I'm going to stay focused.

### Day 7: Jan 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Shared Morning Coffee on Instagram and Twitter.
- Became interested in the hamburger nav from the above. Ended up starting a clone of the nav in Codecademy's exercises. 

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure whether it would be better to focus on one element (ex: trying a bunch of different navs) or just build a project. Maybe a combination of both. The first would be good practice for getting good at specific things, then the second for putting what I know together. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Navigation with sticky sections](https://github.com/charlottejoy/exercises/tree/master/navigation/Sticky_sections).	

### Day 8: Jan 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Sicky today= good time to figure stuff out in a notebook in bed. Tried a couple Project Euler exercises. Added some into Github. Yay! Whiteboard from bed!

**Thoughts:** 
Checked email. [Tertris Loader](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/aEwKMB) was in [Codepen Spark!](https://codepen.io/spark/58) I feel encouraged. 


### Day 9: Jan 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts, read a bit about Google material icons. Yay for newsletters.

**Thoughts:** 
There really is just so much. Took a quick look at JS for astonomy, thoughta bout more CSS images, skins for Light Out. OMG.

### Day 10: Jan 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Inspired by an animation on Instagram, I decided to try creating a thread spinner. I spent waaay longer than I thought I would trying to place the string. I think my goal was to have it come off the end of the page. Left it for today back using vmins and the string edges being visible.

**Thoughts:** 
It's important to decide if the little details are really what you want. Particularly when you have limited time (which is probably most of the time). Start with what's needed, THEN move on to the nice to haves.

### Day 11, Jan 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts, do some breaking down of a design one of the designers at work created for a client. Yay! real world examples. But no sharing on this one. 

**Thoughts:** 
Push in the morning if the github streak is important. I went out and wanted to finish that hour when I got home. I learned some things, but didn't push.

### Day 12, Jan 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts. Lots on that design from work.

**Thoughts:** 
Why is layout so hard? There were a few times there was one simple thing and some other times when it was just wtf mate. I'm relying a lot on flex-box, but I don't know that this is always the best for responsive. I'm seeing a lot of things that seemed to be designed with specific px sizes for different breakpoints. YO! Freecodecamp beta. gonna check you out for your new deisng section. Maybe some globabl thoughts there.

### Day 13, Jan 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Had fun with the thread spinner optical illusion animation (Thaumatrope)
- Need to add prefixes before sharing. Edge was like "no animation for you".

**Thoughts:** 
I like the animation, but it's glitchy on mobile. 2 things: 
- I'd like some software to screen record on my computer. 
- I have to be mindful of how things will work in mobile in terms of performance, not just size.

### Day 14, Jan 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added prefixes. It still doesn't work on Edge and found it didn't work on Safari when at work. 

**Thoughts:** 
It was glitchy on mobile when also running the screen capture app. Guess the 2 together take too much power. 
Realize the Tetris loader also didn't work well on Edge. Cross- Browser TESTING!!!!!

### Day 15, Jan 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.

**Thoughts:** 
Read about Grid and Flexbox.
Cat Love was a picked pen. But it's still not working on Edge and Safari. Not feeling like working on this right now.

### Day 16: Jan 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.

**Thoughts:** 
I made time in the morning and before leaving work, but it can be tricky to get in practice if I don't time things right. Smart phones are awesome. I can reserach all my questions or read about different things on my commute.

### Day 17: Jan 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.
- Worked more on work project.
- Changed name of Udacity's portfolio project to "practice port" and put note that it's out of date wityh link to current profile. It had a lot of views. 
- Replied to a few 100daysofcode questions and had some interesting conversations!

**Thoughts:** 
I can't show the work project and someone else with more experience will be making it. I'm not sure if I should spend my time here. I"m thinking to show what I've got at work. See if anyone can give me some pointers, but to work on projects that I can add to a portfolio.

After working on this layout. A good next project might be a simple portfolio using the FCC project as a guideline. 

REALLY. Even when my code is crap, I need to tweet/ reach out. Maybe especially then. Conversations with other people who are trying is really great.

### Day 18: Jan 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.

**Thoughts:** 
Yesterday, I showed what I put what I was working on in a repo for work. One of my coworkers offered to check it out. She's been really nice, but that is scary. Codepen shows my work as it's happening, there's so much unfinished on it. Makes me think about large projects and how to keep code clean even in the process.

### Day 19: Jan 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.

**Thoughts:** 
15 minutes at a time. A concrete goal. I think this can help.

### Day 20: Jan 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts. Learned that textarea closing tag needs to be on same line, looked at parralax, realized I needed to download and refer to the script. stopped. 
- Came back and played more with a different parallax library http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/
- Got original parallax library to work https://github.com/pixelcog/parallax.js
- Did some FCC beta

**Thoughts:** 
Tired. Want to just do a guided tutorial. Not feeling like working on those final little details today.
After being able to add the parallax affect, I realized that if html had a background colour, or the parallax-window was in a div with background colour it was covered. Trial and error. Parallax slider may have been an easier thing. Need to really read doc instead of just diving in .

### Day 21: Jan 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts.Added the side images, more image and text sizing. 
- Looked at css naming conventions. Heard about BEM. 

**Thoughts:** 
This really could go on forever. I don't like the layout very much. I could add the rows as JS variables to make it easier to customize.

### Day 22: Jan 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added theme capabilities to Lights Out game 

**Thoughts:** 
In hindsight, I see that it might have been better to practice this skill on a static webpage rather than something with other moving parts and that relies on adding clases for it's general functioning.

### Day 23: Jan 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made themes+ their elements into an object
- Read some more Eloquent Javascript

**Thoughts:** 
This was a refresher on accessing data inside of nested objects. I hope with time, all of this will stick

### Day 24: Jan 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added more theme elements. Default theme displayed on load. Can change theme without redrawing game
- Had extra time, so watched some of Wes Bos' What the Flexbox
- Read some more Eloquent Javascript

**Thoughts:** 
 Between the newsletters and Eloquent Javascript + the internet on my phone(!), my commute is full of learning about code. I'm very happy about that. 
 Enjoying having the book to make sure I understand what's going on beneath what I write.

### Day 25: Jan 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added animation after win to Lights Out Game
- Read some more Eloquent Javascript

**Thoughts:** 
After showing someone the game and watching as they were confused with things I knew, I realized how important it is to demonstrate what to do. I thought a bit today about how to indicate what to do + what is happening to a person who had never played this game before. Ideally with little text. If I'm going to show someone a work in progress, be very aware of the limitations and make sure that the essential parts of the experience (such as knowing when you've won before drawing a new game) are there.

### Day 26: Jan 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Lights Out
- Style example
- Finish heart theme colours and shapes
- finish win animation
- add draw transition
- thought about some ways to make clear what to do without words

**Thoughts:** 
I spent a good amount of time thinking about how to have less lines of code. I'll need to rethink how I wrote some of the functions if I'll combine random and choosen in a way that makes sense. 
I could do with a refresher on scope.

### Day 27: Jan 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- fix help style
- add random game draw transition
- improve regular game draw transition
- add title 
- improve help style
- Add fontAwesome, learned how to add it to content

**Thoughts:** 
Breaking things down in to very small pieces is really the way to get things done.
Broke something in Javascript I could not find. So thankful for Github. Last commit had just what I needed.

### Day 28: Jan 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- font awesome, add title, improve help and theme style,

**Thoughts:** 
I might be picking at little things

### Day 29: Jan 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- add date range choice, more theme icons, improve responsive game +options

**Thoughts:** 
I don't feel that confident in my visual choices. I want to either be creating more simple designs (like colour palettes and font combinations that already exist) OR get more comfortable making those design decisions. Maybe take a refresher course online. 
I enjoyed doing the little date range choices.

### Day 30: Jan 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- clean up js, refine themes, naming

**Thoughts:** 
I'm tired. Time seemed to pass slowly and yet it doesn't feel like a lot of progress. I'm not puzzling right now, I'm cleaning up what I"ve made. I don't think I find this part very interesting. But, I did find some repetition in the functions that I cleared up.

### Day 31: Feb 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I added a photo theme. I had tried that towards the beginning, but now I've gotten it to work. 

**Thoughts:** 
It can be challenging when you're really tired, etc. But I think it's important in those moments to find the fun.

### Day 32: Feb 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Looked at some old FCC projects, researched a bit about location
- cleaned up a bit more the lights out game
- layout for Lite Brite

**Thoughts:** 
 I did not feel motivated to create today. I don't hink I had a strong goal in terms of learning or making something really fun. So much cleanup is not inspiring.

### Day 33: Feb 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- I worked on the Light Brite idea

**Thoughts:** 
I really like the logic, so I played with drawing another board, but in hindsight, I wonder if there's a better way to make it happen. At some point, I'm going to get to Eloquent JS's "make a paint game". After I've done that, I'll continue.

### Day 34: Feb 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- eliminating more uneeded JS Yay! naming

**Thoughts:** 
This could really go on forever. I'm sharing it today. It's done. At least for now. 
If I have more time today, I think FCC Beta could be a could place to go again. Those projects are good things and they have new modules. 
I've also got some unfinished projects like the conquer/explore layout, old broken projects. 
I think cleaning/ culling these will be a gradual process. I hate going through clutter in the real world. I imagine I'll procrastinate similarly in this.

1. [Lights Out](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/wpGQOZ?editors=0111)


### Day 35: Feb 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- CSS Drawing

**Thoughts:** 
I was going to do an FCC section and then didn't because I wanted to do something I could commit to Github. I've got to stop the streak  because the goal is to learn, not to have everyday green. 
Also, if I'm going to go for speed, I need to pick simple images. I can see how this is broken down, but it's still more complex than I can do quickly.
My pen- Lights Out was picked! Yay!

### Day 36: Feb 6, 2018- Day 40: Feb 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- FCC tribute page and FCC tribute page
- Reading some Elloquent Javascript

**Thoughts:** 
There's a lot going on with life. I felt discouraged, but I like this. I lost my streak, but I'm going to keep learning. I think the balanced approach is that even if I don't keep a streak or 100 days, or whatever, the goal is to code and to learn. Keep Going!

### Day 41: Feb 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- FCC exercises

**Thoughts:** 
Past few days couldn't connect to a project. Glad FCC is there. 
Watching Cosmos, wondering about programming in science. 

### Day 42: Feb 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
-Working more on Conquer

**Thoughts:** 
Used jQuery for the nav. Added space. At this point, I think it's mostly about colours. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Explore theme](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/VyrNMB?editors=1100)


### Day 43, 44: Feb 13, 14, 2018
- read and worked on Explore theme. I think it's ACTUALLY done

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Explore theme](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/VyrNMB?editors=1100)


### Day 45: Feb 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Fixed logic error in date-based theme for Lights Out
- Finished FCC tribute page for Keith Haring

**Thoughts:** 
The tribute page was less about Haring and more just about the technique I wanted to try. Not sure how I feel about that. 
Feels like it's been a long time since I logged, but apparently, I did 3 days ago. 
Read that CSS supports ariables (except IE doesn't like it). Interesting.

### Day 46-49: Feb 16-19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Did the FCC Survey project

**Thoughts:** 
I have been really bad at logging and tweeting, but I am getting in the coding. For this last project, I felt very organized. I worked on an idea and made a wireframe based on the requirements. Then, I started adding the required fields, then worked on the layouts, then colours and tweeks. I think being this structured really helped me to get it done in a few sessions.

### Day 50-57: Feb 20-27, 2018
I've been working on the landing page project from Free Code Camp. Usng Slack's home page as a model for the layout. I finished the requrements early on, but might be taking too long trying to make this layout. I hope ths is good practice. 

### Feb 28, March 1- I'm sick. Not even notepad coding today. No brainpower. 

### Day 58: March 2, 2018
### Day 59: March 3, 2018
Still working on the landing page, I think it's almost done

**Thoughts:** 
I think I'm still doing it in an organized way, but I don't know that dedicating all of this time to this particular project is the best. I'll try to be a bit more disciplined with the others. Nice looking. Nice working. But one thing at a time, maybe, like if I'm working on Javascript, maybe use Materialize for pretty.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
