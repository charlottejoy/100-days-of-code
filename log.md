# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2018 
#### I didn't start logging until the 5th day, so need to do some digging for this. 

### Day 4: Jan 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Added some advice to my go-to template. Experimented with repeating scenery with css animation. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I was frustrated because I didn't have as much to show as previous days. Today, I tried to focus on some small things. Break it down and have more realistic goals now that I'm back to work. Staying up late= next day's productivity plummets. Better to take a break and come back fresh.

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on a CSS Image tutorial. Tried to modify code to be cleaner.
- Worked on look of Lights Out. Organized things with flexbox, removed shadows, better responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** Not convinved about tutorials not counting, but get that real projects = real problem solving = real learning. 
Might help manage time to focus learning on solving specific issues. Tutorials then will be in moderation or weekends. 

Material design is interesting.

### Day 6: Jan 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Spent way too long trying to decide what to do today. Found an [article suggesting some projects](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178). 
- Worked on the first project. [Copying this layout](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer)

**Thoughts:** I need to create/ find a structured curriculum if I'm going to stay focused. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Responsive layout with yoga-mat inspired colours](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/full/VyrNMB/).	

### Day 7: Jan 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Shared Morning Coffee on Instagram and Twitter.
- Became interested in the hamburger nav from the above. Ended up starting a clone of the nav in Codecademy's exercises. 

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure whether it would be better to focus on one element (ex: trying a bunch of different navs) or just build a project. Maybe a combination of both. The first would be good practice for getting good at specific things, then the second for putting what I know together. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Navigation with sticky sections](https://github.com/charlottejoy/exercises/tree/master/navigation/Sticky_sections).	

### Day 8: Jan 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Sicky today= good time to figure stuff out in a notebook in bed. Tried a couple Project Euler exercises. Added some into Github. Yay! Whiteboard from bed!

**Thoughts:** 
Checked email. [Tertris Loader](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/aEwKMB) was in [Codepen Spark!](https://codepen.io/spark/58) I feel encouraged.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
