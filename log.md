# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2018 
#### I didn't start logging until the 5th day, so need to do some digging for this. 

### Day 4: Jan 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Added some advice to my go-to template. Experimented with repeating scenery with css animation. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I was frustrated because I didn't have as much to show as previous days. Today, I tried to focus on some small things. Break it down and have more realistic goals now that I'm back to work. Staying up late= next day's productivity plummets. Better to take a break and come back fresh.

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on a CSS Image tutorial. Tried to modify code to be cleaner.
- Worked on look of Lights Out. Organized things with flexbox, removed shadows, better responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** Not convinved about tutorials not counting, but get that real projects = real problem solving = real learning. 
Might help manage time to focus learning on solving specific issues. Tutorials then will be in moderation or weekends. 

Material design is interesting.

### Day 6: Jan 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Spent way too long trying to decide what to do today. Found an [article suggesting some projects](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178). 
- Worked on the first project. [Copying this layout](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer)

**Thoughts:** I need to create/ find a structured curriculum if I'm going to stay focused.

### Day 7: Jan 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Shared Morning Coffee on Instagram and Twitter.
- Became interested in the hamburger nav from the above. Ended up starting a clone of the nav in Codecademy's exercises. 

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure whether it would be better to focus on one element (ex: trying a bunch of different navs) or just build a project. Maybe a combination of both. The first would be good practice for getting good at specific things, then the second for putting what I know together. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Navigation with sticky sections](https://github.com/charlottejoy/exercises/tree/master/navigation/Sticky_sections).	

### Day 8: Jan 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Sicky today= good time to figure stuff out in a notebook in bed. Tried a couple Project Euler exercises. Added some into Github. Yay! Whiteboard from bed!

**Thoughts:** 
Checked email. [Tertris Loader](https://codepen.io/charlottejoy/pen/aEwKMB) was in [Codepen Spark!](https://codepen.io/spark/58) I feel encouraged. 


### Day 9: Jan 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts, read a bit about Google material icons. Yay for newsletters.

**Thoughts:** 
There really is just so much. Took a quick look at JS for astonomy, thoughta bout more CSS images, skins for Light Out. OMG.

### Day 10: Jan 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Inspired by an animation on Instagram, I decided to try creating a thread spinner. I spent waaay longer than I thought I would trying to place the string. I think my goal was to have it come off the end of the page. Left it for today back using vmins and the string edges being visible.

**Thoughts:** 
It's important to decide if the little details are really what you want. Particularly when you have limited time (which is probably most of the time). Start with what's needed, THEN move on to the nice to haves.

### Day 11, Jan 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts, do some breaking down of a design one of the designers at work created for a client. Yay! real world examples. But no sharing on this one. 

**Thoughts:** 
Push in the morning if the github streak is important. I went out and wanted to finish that hour when I got home. I learned some things, but didn't push.

### Day 12, Jan 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Working more on layouts. Lots on that design from work.

**Thoughts:** 
Why is layout so hard? There were a few times there was one simple thing and some other times when it was just wtf mate. I'm relying a lot on flex-box, but I don't know that this is always the best for responsive. I'm seeing a lot of things that seemed to be designed with specific px sizes for different breakpoints. YO! Freecodecamp beta. gonna check you out for your new deisng section. Maybe some globabl thoughts there.

### Day 13, Jan 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Had fun with the thread spinner optical illusion animation (Thaumatrop)
- Need to add prefixes before sharing. Edge was like "no animation for you".

**Thoughts:** 
I like the animation, but it's glitchy on mobile. 2 things: 
- I'd like some software to screen record on my computer. 
- I have to be mindful of how things will work in mobile in terms of performance, not just size.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
