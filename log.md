# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 2, 2018 
#### I didn't start logging until the 5th day, so need to do some digging for this. 

### Day 4: Jan 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Added some advice to my go-to template. Experimented with repeating scenery with css animation. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I was frustrated because I didn't have as much to show as previous days. Today, I tried to focus on some small things. Break it down and have more realistic goals now that I'm back to work. Staying up late= next day's productivity plummets. Better to take a break and come back fresh.

### Day 5: Jan 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on a CSS Image tutorial. Tried to modify code to be cleaner.
- Worked on look of Lights Out. Organized things with flexbox, removed shadows, better responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** Not convinved about tutorials not counting, but get that real projects = real problem solving = real learning. 
Might help manage time to focus learning on solving specific issues. Tutorials then will be in moderation or weekends. 

Material design is interesting.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
